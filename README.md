# Clippy! The kind virus

Although he's not a malicious virus, he doesn't like when people have their trash bin full.

## Running

### Python script

After downloading the project, go to its directory and install the requirements:

```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

after that just run [runner.py](runner.py) and you're ready for clippy's arrival !


### .EXE

Although it doesn't provide the full experience due to some trouble in the conversion, its a way simpler approach, as you only have to run [Clippy!.exe](Clippy!/Clippy!.exe).

## Purpose

My objective with this project was just to learn a bit more about Python and other languages, like VBS and PS1, while making something fun to show some close friends that won't judge me when I ask them to install my virus.
